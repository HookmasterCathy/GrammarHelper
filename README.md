# GrammarHelper
Making a Program to diagram sentences. This Program Does not yet provide a full Diagram. This program can find Definitions,
parts of grammar for a single word, or the Subject and Predicate of a sentence.

The features this project includes are as Follows:

Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

DIRECTIONS
To work this program needs to be able to find the "Grammar.txt" Document.
Please change the variable "Filepath" as labled in the code to the filepath of the "Grammar.txt" document. example "C:\grammer.txt"
